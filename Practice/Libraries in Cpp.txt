Libraries

Process of building a program:
Preprocessor - essentially anything that begins with #
Compilation - source files are compiled into object files (.o)
Link - combine all .o files with any libraries into an executable file (.exe or no suffix)

Choice between static and dynamic libraries when running code.
Static libraries: Files containing c++ code which are actually compiled into code. 
Dynamic libraries: Contains code the program finds while the program is running.
			cout uses the std dynamic library.

Static: windows - XYZ.lib UNIX/Linux - XYZ.a
Dynamic: windows - XYZ.dll UNIX/Linux - libXYZ.so Mac - XYZ.dylib
